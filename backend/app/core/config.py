"""
One place for every setting the backend reads.

The core fields are required - the whole application, not just the AI module,
needs a real database, real auth and certificate storage to run at all.

Everything below them is specific to the AI assistant and voice relay, and
is optional with a safe default:

- An empty ANTHROPIC_API_KEY means the AI module runs in deterministic mock
  mode. That is what the offline test suite relies on, and what keeps the
  assistant demoable with no network at all.
- An empty SARVAM_API_KEY means the voice router reports realtime voice as
  unavailable, and the frontend falls back to the browser's own narrator.

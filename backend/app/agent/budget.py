"""
Hard caps for one turn of the agent loop, plus the usage record for that turn.

An agentic loop's real failure mode is not that it is complicated - it is that
an unbounded loop keeps calling the model, keeps costing money, and keeps the
user waiting. Every limit here is enforced in code rather than requested in the
prompt, because a prompt is a suggestion and a counter is not.

When a cap trips we do NOT raise. exhausted() flips to True, the loop feeds the
model a short "answer from what you already have" note, and the model produces
one final summary. The student gets a real, slightly less complete answer
instead of a 500. That behaviour is what makes the caps safe to set tight.

The usage numbers collected here are also the source of the cost and latency
figures in docs/AI_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md, section 8 - including the
measured cache_read_input_tokens, which is how we show that prompt caching
genuinely does not fire on Haiku 4.5 rather than just asserting it.

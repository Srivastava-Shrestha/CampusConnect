Return STRICT JSON only, matching this shape:
{"keywords": [<1-5 short interest words/phrases, the student's own words or close synonyms>],

   the student's own words, changed as little as possible. If the WHOLE message is off-topic,
   return an empty string. If NONE of it is off-topic, return the message essentially unchanged.>}

Rules:
- keywords: the actual topics/interests the student named, stripped of filler like "show me", "can you", "I have an interest in". These are matched literally against the words a club uses to describe ITSELF, so include the student's own word AND the vocabulary a club on that topic would actually use - a student saying "climate" will never literally match a club that calls itself "Environmental and Sustainability... greener campus, tree plantation", so return both. Stay on-topic: only words that genuinely name the same subject, never a broader category word just to widen the net. Never include a word whose only job in the sentence is describing what KIND of thing is being asked for rather than what it's about - words like "event", "events", "activity", "activities", "session", "workshop", "programme", "happening", "planned", "club", "upcoming", "any", "schedule" describe the shape of the request, not a topic, and would wrongly match any club whose own description happens to mention hosting events at all. "Activity" in particular is just another word for "event" here - a student asking "any planned activity" is asking about events, not about a club that has the word "activity" in its description. If you strip those out and nothing topical is left (e.g. "any upcoming events?" or "is there any activity planned?" with no subject), return an empty keywords list rather than keeping the request-shape words as if they were topics.
- keywords must also carry no polarity or preference words. "less competitive", "beginner friendly", "not too serious" describe what the student wants the club to BE LIKE, not what it is about - and matched literally they do the opposite of what was asked ("less competitive" matches a club describing itself as "competitive programming"). Drop them entirely; keep only the subject.
- category: only ever a value copied verbatim from the CATEGORIES list given, or null. Never invent one.
- time_scope: "past" if they ask about something that already happened (last week, previous, before), "upcoming" if they ask about what's coming/next/soon, "any" if unclear or not about events at all.
- wants_events: default to false. Only true when the message itself uses event-ish language (event, events, activity, activities, anything planned, anything on, happening, schedule, tournament, workshop, session, when is/does). Treat "activity" and "event" as the same thing - "is there any activity planned" is an events question - true even if a club/topic is also named in the same message (e.g. "does the gaming club have any events" is both a club topic AND wants_events=true). A message that ONLY asks about a club/topic in general - "do you have something for X", "tell me about X", "any X club" - is wants_events=false, even if that club happens to run events; the student didn't ask about them.
- on_topic: default to true - err on the side of true whenever the message could plausibly be about finding a club, an event or something to do on campus, even with no topic named ("suggest me something", "what should I join", "anything fun?") and even when it is phrased as wanting to DO something rather than asking to FIND a club for it ("I have a cool startup idea, where do I find like-minded people" is on_topic - it is a club search phrased as a goal, keywords ["startup", "entrepreneurship"]). This bias toward true is not weakened by the clean_query rule above - clean_query only removes a part that is a clearly different, unrelated request; it never makes an otherwise on-topic message become off-topic. Only false when it is clearly about something else entirely: general knowledge or maths ("what is 2 plus 2"), coding help, the weather, or a question about the conversation itself. A false here suppresses club/event suggestions for the turn, so a wrong false is worse than a wrong true.
- date_range: only when the message names a specific day or window - "tomorrow", "tonight", "this weekend", "next week", "on the 24th", "last month". Compute it against TODAY given below, and make it inclusive of both ends (a single day has from == to). Leave BOTH null when no specific window is named: "upcoming", "any events", "what's next" are NOT date ranges - time_scope already covers those.
- clean_query exists because a message can ask for two different things at once - a real club question, plus something unrelated riding along with it ("suggest me a coding club, also what is 17*23"). The reply is written by a SEPARATE step that only ever sees clean_query, never your original input - so this is not a hint or a suggestion, it is the only thing standing between the unrelated part and getting answered. Cut it out completely rather than flagging it. Do not just trim polite filler here (that is what keywords already handles) - only remove a part that is a genuinely different request: a question this assistant should never answer regardless of how the rest of the message reads. A message that is entirely a club/event question, however it's phrased, keeps clean_query equal to itself.

EXAMPLES (follow this pattern exactly - request-shape words never survive into keywords, even when a real topic sits right next to them; assume TODAY is 2026-08-22 for these):

_PRONOUN_RULE = """
PREVIOUS MESSAGE (the student's last message before this one, for context only):
{previous}

Use it for TWO purposes, and nothing else:
1. If the current message is a follow-up that names no topic of its own -
   "any upcoming events for this", "what about them", "tell me more" - resolve
   what it refers to and put THAT topic in keywords.
2. If the current message is a refinement that only states a preference -
   "I'm a beginner", "something less competitive" - carry the PREVIOUS topic
   into keywords, since the refinement itself contributes no subject. The
   preference words themselves still never become keywords.

Otherwise ignore it completely. If the current message names its own topic, the
previous message must not contribute a single keyword: a student who asked
about dance and then asks "any coding clubs?" wants coding only, and leaking
"dance" into that turn is worse than the unresolved pronoun this rule fixes.

The keyword rules above apply to anything taken from the previous message just
as they do to the current one. If the previous message was ITSELF a topicless
follow-up ("is there any activity planned"), it contains no subject to carry -
return an empty keywords list. Never fall back to lifting a request-shape word
like "activity", "event" or "planned" out of it just to have something to
return; that word matches no club's own description and turns the turn into a
false "nothing found".

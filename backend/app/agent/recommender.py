"""
Campus Connect - AI Club & Event Recommender (deterministic core).

Design rule (Episteme pattern): every function here is PURE and deterministic.
The LLM only writes free-text reasons on top of this ranking; it is NEVER
allowed to decide which clubs exist or to invent entities. If the LLM call
fails, callers fall back to the deterministic order produced here.

No network calls, no DB access, no email fields. Unit-testable in isolation.
Takes plain dicts so it works before the clubs/events schema exists.
